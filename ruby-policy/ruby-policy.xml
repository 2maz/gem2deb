    <title>Background</title>
    
    <para>
      There are several <quote>subpolicies</quote> in Debian.  Their
      purpose is to provide guidelines and packaging requirements in
      addition to the <ulink url="&debian-policy;">Debian
      Policy</ulink> when specific topic are concerned, such as
      packages providing Perl libraries, Emacs extensions...
    </para>

    <para>
      Similarly to the other subpolicies, the aim of the Debian Ruby
      Policy is to unify the packaging of Ruby libraries and programs
      under a single well-defined structure that packagers and users
      alike can rely on.
    </para>
      
    
    <para>
      As packaging practices and Ruby-related technologies evolve over
      time, this Policy is to some extent a permanent
      <quote>work-in-progress</quote>. Please feel free to comment and
      suggest improvements on the &dr-ldo; mailing list.

      i.e. normative statements about how Ruby-related packages should
      be organized. The verbs &must;, &mustnot;, &may; and ;&should;
      are used with the same meanings as in the <ulink
      url="&debian-policy;">Debian Policy</ulink>.
