gem2deb is a set of tools to create Debian packages from Rubygems

The workflow looks like:
    Download gem:
    gem fetch foo
        |
        v
    Create a tarball. It contains the gem spec as metadata.yml
    gem2tgz foo-1.2.gem
        |
        v
    Convert to a Debian source package with sane defaults:
    dh-make-ruby foo-1.2.tar.gz
        |
        v
    Modify, if needed
        |
        v
    Build the package:
    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

Alternatively, you can use the gem2deb command, that tries to do
everything automatically.

The generated Debian source package uses Debhelper 7 with a specific
build system called "ruby". That buildsystem uses the dh_ruby tool for
the various steps (clean, build, test, install).


Building from source and testing this package:
==============================================
# install build-dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper rake libshoulda-ruby1.8 \
 libmocha-ruby1.8 rubygems1.8 ruby-pkg-tools ruby1.8-dev ruby1.9.1-dev
# build the package
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
# install
sudo debi

Current status:
gem2tgz and dh-make-ruby work.
dh_ruby is not yet feature-comparable with setup.rb, and needs some work.
