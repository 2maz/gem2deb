use ruby1.9.1 by default
========================

Currently we build packages for both 1.8 and 1.9.1, but 1.8 is still considered
to be the "default version". As soon as Debian switches to 1.9.1 being the
default, gem2deb should do so as well.

dh_ruby: solve the --install X the world situation
==================================================

Currently, everything that dh_ruby does happens during `dh_ruby --install`.
--configure, --build and --test are no-ops. We should either fix this, or
remove these actions and leave only --install and --clean (and make --install
the default so that we can call just `dh_ruby`).

Rubygems integration
====================

It would be nice if Rubygems recognized packages created by gem2deb. For this,
we need to install a .gemspec file somewhere, and patch Rubygems to look there
for gemspecs as well (Rubygems already supports looking at multiple places for
gemspecs). This should probably be discussed with Rubygems developers to
reach the better integration possible and avoid noise.

Other distributions may be already doing this, we should do some reasearch.

autopkgtest support
===================

It would ne nice to have some sort of integration with autopkgtest (DEP-8), so
that we could automatically run the automated testes of the package against the
installed package instead of against the source package. This would probably be
done by subclassing the test runner to not mess with the load paths, i.e. when
the test code require's something, that something would come from the system
libraries.

See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=637917

syntax/load test
================

This should be a minimal test that would try to check the syntax of every
source file against all supported Ruby interpreters to make sure the code is
valid everywhere.

See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=645357

(with the rising usage of http://travis-ci.org/, compatibility should not be an
issue for most new packages, but it might be for "legacy", or not very active
packages)

Support Rubinius
================

This includes both installing stuff to be used by Rubinius, including
extensions, and being able to run gem2deb under Rubinius. See the `rake test`
lines in debian/rules, we should add one like that for Rubinius.

Support JRuby
=============

This includes both installing stuff to be used by JRuby, including
extensions, and being able to run gem2deb under JRuby. See the `rake test`
lines in debian/rules, we should add one like that for JRuby.

increase the coverage of the test suite
=======================================

We should packages simplecov (http://rubygems.org/gems/simplecov), run it
against gem2deb, and find places that are not covered by the test suite.

Also, some places might be being run, but not checked at all. One example
if the code that handles XS-Ruby-Versions.
