=head1 HOW THE CONVERSION WORKS

A gem named I<mygem-0.1.0.gem> is converted in a tarball with
(approximately) the following steps:

  mkdir mygem-0.1.0
  cd mygem-0.1.0
  tar xfm /absolute/path/to/mygem-0.1.0.gem
  tar xzfm data.tar.gz
  zcat metadata.gz > metadata.yml
  rm -f data.tar.gz metadata.gz
  cd ..
  tar czf mygem-0.1.0.tar.gz mygem-0.1.0
  rm -rf mygem-0.1.0

The generated tarball has the following properties:

=over

=item Files

It contains all the files the gem contains.

=item Metadata

It contains the gem metadata ends up in a file named ``metadata.yml`` inside the I<mygem-0.1.0> directory.
