=head1 NAME

dh-make-ruby - build Debian source package from Ruby library

=head1 USAGE

B<dh-make-ruby> [I<OPTIONS>] I<TARBALL>|I<DIRECTORY>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh-make-ruby> will create a basic Debian source package from a tarball named
I<TARBALL> generated with B<gem2tgz>, or from a I<DIRECTORY> containing Ruby
code and metadata in a .gemspec file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-p PACKAGE>, B<--package PACKAGE>

Uses PACKAGE as package name. By default, new packages will be named as
ruby-$gem, where $gem is the upstream name. If the package is mainly used as a
library, then it should use the default. On the other hand, if the packages is
mainly used as an application, then you should drop the ruby- prefix by using
this option an explicit package u.

=item B<--ruby-versions VERSIONS>

Ruby versions to build the package for. This is used to generate the
X-Ruby-Versions: field in the source package, that can later be used to tune
this value.  By default, gem2deb generates a package that works on all known
Ruby versions, but it might be necessary to only build the package for Ruby
1.8, for example (using B<--ruby-versions "ruby1.8">).

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Displays the help

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Displays version information and exits.
