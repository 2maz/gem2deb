21:38 < Mithrandir> lucas: gem fetch yajl-ruby; gem2deb yajl-ruby-0.8.1.gem errors out with a duplicate Package field

21:49 < Mithrandir> I think that's because the .so is in /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux/yajl.so
21:50 < Mithrandir> yup, doing ln -s .  /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux/yajl works around it.
