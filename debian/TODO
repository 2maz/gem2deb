it should be possible to rewrite shebangs to something else than ruby1.8


native packages should ship everything in the same binary package, not in 3 different packages.
then, dependencies (shlibs) should be hacked accordingly.

Either you replace the dependency associated to the interpreters' libraries
by providing debian/shlibs.local (or any other file that you indicate with
-L) or you tell dpkg-shlibdeps to put the dependencies for the .so files
of interest in another variable like ${shlibs:Suggest} (mixing -d and -e
options as appropriate on the command line).


there should be a way to opt out ruby1.9.1 build (example of package failing: termios)

write test suite for Ruby-Versions settings
