  * Escape including the .git directory in a tar archive.

  * Extract method to read the supported Ruby versions
  * Packages generated by dh-make-ruby now depend on 'ruby | ruby-interpreter'

    #!/usr/bin/ruby as shebang; packages for specific versions use the
    corresponding binary in the shebang.

  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2

gem2deb (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Export RUBY_TEST_VERSION and RUBY_TEST_BIN environment variables
    when running tests.
  * Run make distclean || make clean instead of just make clean
  * When building extensions, run the test suite for a given version immediately
    after building the extension for this version. The previous behaviour
    resulted in testing each ruby implementation with the last extension to be
    built.
  * Add bin/gen-ruby-trans-pkgs: script to generate debian/control snippets
    for transitional packages
